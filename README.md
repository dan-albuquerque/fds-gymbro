## Development 

Throughout the development of our project, we utilized pair programming, a technique where two programmers work together on a single task. In our first sprint, we divided our team into three pairs, with each pair assigned a user story to work on. Carlos and Arthur worked on the user story "Como usu√°rio, gostaria de adicionar os pesos dos meus exerc√≠cios." Gabriel Pires and Danilo worked on "Como usu√°rio, gostaria de ter tipos de treinos diferentes para escolher." Finally, Gabriel Rossiter and Bernardo worked on "Como usu√°rio, gostaria de monitorar meu sono."

For our second sprint, we mixed up the pairs and assigned new user stories. Danilo and Gabriel Rossiter worked on "Como usu√°rio, gostaria de planejar meus dias e hor√°rios de treinos." Bernardo and Carlos tackled "Como um iniciante, gostaria de ver as execu√ß√µes dos exerc√≠cios que estou fazendo." Finally, Gabriel Pires and Arthur worked on "Como usu√°rio, gostaria de inserir meu objetivo com a academia."

During the development of each user story, we frequently rotated the roles of driver and navigator, ensuring that each team member had an opportunity to perform both roles. We also used a combination of online tools, such as Discord, and in-person meetings to facilitate collaboration.

Overall, pair programming proved to be an effective way for our team to work together, promote knowledge sharing, and increase code quality. We believe that by utilizing this approach, we were able to deliver a better product to our users.
