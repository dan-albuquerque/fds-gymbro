# GymBro üèãÔ∏èüèÜ

Create, edit and manage gym workouts with precision üìàüìä 

GymBro is an application which will serve as an incentive for people (mostly beginners) who wish to get into a fit life by creating  workouts based on their own reality, through inputs in the application. Apart from that, GymBro is also an app that manages your workout and tracks your progress in creative ways. 

## How to use it

Just enter your name, age, weight, height, your health problems, and your objective with your workout (Whether it be weight loss, muscle resistance or hypertrophy) and GymBro will show the best workout options for you. Furthermore, you will be able to edit and change exercises at any time, even seeing their correct execution through a helpful in-app guide.

Keep your data updated and mark all the workouts you do. Gymbro will show your progress and congratulate you when you reach your objectives in fun ways that keep the user entertained and eager to improve.

## Development 

Throughout the course of our dev time, It‚Äôs always important to use pair programming, a type of Agile Software XP Method method where two people work together to design, test and code user stories. We achieved this by separating our team in groups of 2: Arthur Paixao and Carlos Augusto, Gabriel Pires and Danilo Albuquerque and last but not least, Bernardo Coutinho and Gabriel Rossiter. You can see how we managed our user stories to each group on our Jira page, linked below.

Using tools like discord for calls as well as meetings in person, we managed to, whenever possible, have these duos work together, assigning the duties of navigator and driver, understanding the limitations of each of us in Django, Html, Css and JavaScript, as we helped each other learn new things, seeing as how we¬¥re still a long way from mastering all of these.

It is important to note that we swapped these jobs frequently, meaning we all got a chance to be navigators and drivers. We hope that utilizing pair programming on our project¬¥s development will bring a better user experience for everyone, the same way it brought a better development experience to us!
