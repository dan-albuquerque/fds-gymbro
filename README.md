# GymBro üèãÔ∏èüèÜ

Create, edit and manage gym workouts with precision üìàüìä 

GymBro is an application which will serve as an incentive for people (mostly beginners) who wish to get into a fit life by having
workouts based on their own reality, through inputs in the application. Apart from that, GymBro is also an app that manages your workout and tracks your progress in creative ways. 

## How to use it

Just enter your name, age, weight, height, and your objective with your workout (Whether it be weight loss, muscle resistance or hypertrophy) and GymBro will show workout options for you with your specifications. Furthermore, even seeing their correct execution through a helpful in-app guide.

Keep your data updated and mark all the workouts you do. Gymbro will show your progress and congratulate you when you reach your objectives in fun ways that keep the user entertained and eager to improve.

## Pair Programming 

The use of pair programming has been efficient in our project as it increases productivity in implementing functionalities. Each story represented on the kanban board was completed by a pair. Therefore, each pair was responsible for one story.

Pair programming is an agile development technique in which two programmers work together on implementing a functionality. One of them is the "driver," who writes the code. The other is the "navigator," who reviews each line of code and tells the "driver" what to write. The dynamic is that the programmers switch roles frequently during the project to allow for the identification and correction of as many errors as possible, as well as to encourage greater interaction and utilization of each programmer's different skills.

First sprint: We divided our team into three pairs, with each pair assigned a user story to work on. Carlos and Arthur worked on the user story "Como usu√°rio, gostaria de adicionar os pesos dos meus exerc√≠cios." Gabriel Pires and Danilo worked on "Como usu√°rio, gostaria de ter tipos de treinos diferentes para escolher." Finally, Gabriel Rossiter and Bernardo worked on "Como usu√°rio, gostaria de monitorar meu sono."
Conclusion: It was concluded that the division into pairs was effective, but it could have been better. The problem was that we tried to group people with similar skills. For example, the first pair consisted of individuals with a better understanding of Django, while the second pair consisted of individuals with a stronger understanding of front-end and design. The third pair consisted of individuals who had a good grasp of the process but lacked knowledge of Django. As a result, each story encountered some issues that could have been resolved with the assistance of someone from another pair.

Second sprint: we mixed up the pairs and assigned new user stories. Danilo and Gabriel Rossiter worked on "Como usu√°rio, gostaria de planejar meus dias e hor√°rios de treinos." Bernardo and Carlos tackled "Como um iniciante, gostaria de ver as execu√ß√µes dos exerc√≠cios que estou fazendo." Finally, Gabriel Pires and Arthur worked on "Como usu√°rio, gostaria de inserir meu objetivo com a academia."
Conclusion: The dynamic proved to be highly efficient, as the learning experience for each programmer increased significantly. Working with different individuals allowed for a broader range of knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the code quality improved, as each pair now possesses a greater variety of skills. Additionally, at this stage of the project, all participants already had a solid understanding of Django.

Plans for next sprint: For the next sprint, we should once again change the pairs to create new combinations that haven't been formed yet. This way, we can ensure a greater diversity of skills within each pair and allow each pair to develop new abilities by working with different partners. Next pairs: Gabriel Pires & Carlos, Gabriel Rossiter & Arthur, Danilo & Bernardo.

Overall, pair programming proved to be an effective way for our team to work together, promote knowledge sharing, and increase code quality. We believe that by utilizing this approach, we were able to deliver a better product to our users.
